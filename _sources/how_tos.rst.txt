This section is a list of miscellaneous task-oriented tutorials for specific usages of ``adfluo``

Dealing with large datasets
---------------------------

This tutorial is aimed relevant if you're planning on using ``adfluo`` to extract feature from large datasets and extraction pipelines that:

- have samples that require a large amount of memory to be processed
  (e.g. : very long audio recordings)
- have so many small samples that loading all of them at once might fill
  your computer's memory (e.g: a myriad of small images)
- have implemented features that output intermediate data that might also be very large
- some or all of the above
